# CDITools

A bunch of tools written in C to convert graphics in CDI format (CLUT8), Extracting ADPCM files from AIFF files
as well as a simple tool for padding.

These were originally written by Charles Doty for Frog Feast and he released the source code a while later.

The tools however needed a C++ compiler as well as Windows header files so i partially rewrote them
to remove the dependency on Windows functions/headers.
